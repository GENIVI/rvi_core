# REVIEW NOTES BY MAGNUS:
1. Shall "internal" services be specially marked?<br>
How about ```jlr.com/vin/123456/dm/cert_provision``` is renamed
 ```jlr.com/vin/123456/dm/$cert_provision``` .<br>
All services starting with ```$``` are routed to RVI-internal code.

2. Per-service configuration?
Current setup:
```
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "message",
        "service": "jlr.com/vin/123456/dm/var_read",
        "timeout" : 5000,
        "params": {
            "variable" : ["varname1","varname2"]
         }
```		 

Suggested change:

```
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "message",
        "service": "jlr.com/vin/123456/dm/var_read",
        "timeout" : 5000,
        "params": {
	        "service" : "jlr.com/vin/123456/body/lock",
            "variable" : ["varname1","varname2"]
         }
```		 

Similar setup for setting configuration.


Remote Vehicle Interface (RVI) Core Services
============================================

This document specifies the core services of the Remote Vehicle Interface (RVI)
framework.

Remote Vehicle Interface (RVI) is a universal framework for devices to interact
with other devices. The term *device* losely refers to vehicles, mobile devices,
cloud servers etc. which all can transparently connect to and exchange data with
each other over a variety of networks.

RVI Core represents the core of the RVI framework. Any node looking to exchange
data with other nodes over RVI must implement RVI Core. Details on RVI Core and
the RVI specification in general can be found at
[RVI](https://github.com/PDXostc/rvi_core).

RVI Core itself is agnostic to the data that is sent. It provides, however, an
addressing and routing scheme that allows the indentification of a service on
any device in a global namespace. The syntax of a service name is

    [organization]/[path]
* [organization]
  A domain name describing the organization that hosts a sub-section of the root.
  All service paths under the domain name are managed by the given organization.
* [path]
  A path to access a given service. Path segments are separated by `/`.

Technically, the organization is just a part of the path. However, it is
separated because of the responsibility and ability of the organization to
manage all subpaths below itself.

A typical service name for a vehicle that specifies a service to lock a door:

    message:jaguarlandrover.com/vin/1HGCM82633A004352/services/body/lock
    
Services can freely be defined and implemented by anyone for any purpose as long
as the global name space is not violated (hence the organization). RVI defines
a couple of core services that are specified by this document.

RVI Service Messages
--------------------

RVI service messages are encoded as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Remote
Procedure Calls (RPC) (JSON-RPC).

    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "method": "message",
        "service": "jlr.com/vin/123456/logging/subscribe",
        "timeout" : 5000,
        "params": {
            "channels":, ["location", "odometer", "speed"],
            "reporting_interval": 5000
         }
    }
		
* jsonrpc - JSON-RPC version number.
* id - Request ID, used to match the response to the request.
* method - Method to be invoked. For RVI the method is ```message```.
* service - The full service name.
* timeout - Timeout in seconds since UNIX Epoch UTC (January 1, 1970 UTC).
* params - Array of objects passed to `method` as parameters.


RVI Core Services
-----------------

### Device Setup

Services for configuring the device with information such as security
certificates, configuration variables etc to initially bootstrap the
device.

**Definitions**<br>

* Auth certificate<br>
  Sent between two RVI nodes at session setup. Only contains device-specific public key. Not signed

* Node certificate<br>
  Contains a list of service prefixes that the sending node has the right to invoke.<br>
  Contains a list of service prefixes that the sending node has the right to register.<br>
  Signed by root server.

#### Initial provisioning at app install

An device-specific key pair is generated by device and stored locally.

The app has one pre-provisioned node certificate, allowing it to invoke jlr.com/provisioning/setup.

The device has the IP address of its provisioning server.

#### Device setup process

1. Device connects to provisioning server<br>
The app is started for the first time and connects to the provisioning server.

2. Device sends authenticate to server<br>
The command contains the auth cert (device public key) and the single,
pre-provisioned node certificate giving the device the right to
invoke ```jlr.com/provisioning/setup``` and the right to 
register ```jlr.com/mobile/123456/dm/cert_provision```.<br>
See [Device Management](#device-management) for details.
                        
3. Server sends authenticate to device<br>
The server's auth cert (server public key) is sent, but no node
certificates, thus giving the server no rights to register or invoke
services with the device.

4. Device sends a service announce to server<br>
The command contains the single service ```jlr.com/mobile/123456/dm/cert_provision```,
which can be invoked by the provisioning service to install a new
certificate on the device.

5. Server sends a service announce to device<br>
The command contains the service ```jlr.com/provisioning/setup```.

6. Device invokes ```jlr.com/provisioning/setup``` on server<br>
The sole argument is the device ID, which is 1234.  The command is
validated by the server through the pre-provisioned cert.

7. Provisioning service creates node certificates<br>
The created cert gives the holder the right to invoke ```jlr.com/vin/ABCD/unlock```.<br>
The certificate also gives the holder the right to register jlr.com/mobile/1234/status.<br>
The certificate is signed by root cert and encrypted with device public key from step 2.<br>

8. Sideband token transmission from provisioning service to device<br>
The provsioning server transmits a 128 bit random token to the device
using a sideband channel such as SMS or similar.

10. Device invokes ```jlr.com/provisioning/request_certificate``` on server<br>
The device provides its public key and the token received in step 9 as
arguments to the call.

11. Provisioning service invokes ```jlr.com/mobile/123456/dm/cert_provision```<br>
The provisioning service invokes certificate provisioning service on
the device, announced by the device to the service in step 4, to
install the certificate created in step 7.

12. Device unpacks and stores certificate<br>
The device decrypts the certificate using its private key, validates
the signature against a locally installed root certificate.




#### Device authentication / authorization.<br>

1. Device connects to vehicle ABCD<br>
Connection is done over bluetooth, with no Internet connection.

2. Device sends authenticate to vehicle<br>
The command contains the auth cert together with the received node
certificate, proving that it has the right to invoke  ```jlr.com/vin/ABCD/unlock```.
It also proves that the device has the right to register
<br> ```jlr.com/mobile/1234/status```.

3. Vehicle sends authenticate to device<br>
The server's auth cert (server public key) is sent, together with a
pre-provisioned node certificate giving it the rights to register  ```jlr.com/vin/ABCD/unlock```.<br>
The certificate also gives the vehicle the right to invoke ```jlr.com/mobile/*/status```.

4. Device sends service announce to vehicle<br>
The command contains ```jlr.com/mobile/1234/status```.<br>
Vehicle validates that the vehicle has the right to register this
service against the certificate received in step 2.

5. Vehicle sends service announce to device<br>
The command contains the service ```jlr.com/vin/ABCD/unlock```.<br>
Device validates the registration against right to register services
listed in certificate received in step 3.

6. Device sends service announce to vehicle<br>
The command contains the service ```jlr.com/mobile/1234/status```.<br>
Vehicle validates the registration against right to register services
listed in certificate received in step 2.

7. Vehicle invokes ```jlr.com/mobile/1234/status``` on device<br>
Command contains current state (locked/unlocked, etc) that is used to
update device UI.

8. Device invokes ```jlr.com/vin/ABCD/unlock``` on vehicle<br>
Vehicle validates the right to invoke against certificate received in
step 2.

### Thwarting malicious RVI nodes

1. [standard session setup]

2. Device sends authenticate command to server<br>
The command contains the auth cert together with a node cert showing
that the device has the right to register register ```jlr.com/mobile/1234/receive_bitcoin```.

3. [server responds with its own authenticate]

4. Device sends false service announce to server<br>
The commands contains the service ```jlr.com/mobile/9999/receive_bitcoin```.

5. Server rejects the service announce
Since the announced service does not match the service in the
certificate received in step 2, the announcement is rejected and no
invocations to ```jlr.com/mobile/9999/receive_bitcoin``` will be routed to
device.

### Over-the-Air Update

RVI can transmit any type of file from one device to another. The most typical
application is software over the air updates (SOTA) where a server sends software
packages to a device for the device to install. RVI implements file transmission
through a series of services that are executed in a particular sequence of events.
For the following we use the term

* server - for a device withing to transmit a file to another device
* client - for a device receiving a file transmission

Sequence of events:

1. The server first sends the `notify` message to the client with the description
   of the download and a unique ID to identify the file transmission transaction.
   The client can use the description to inform a user of the pending download.
2. The client can then either
   * accept the file transmission by sending `initiate_download` to the server, or
   * reject the file transmission by sending `cancel_download` to the server
3. If the server receives an `initiate_download` response it initiates the file
   download by sinding `start` to the client together with the `file size` and a
   `chunk size` indicating the total size of the download and the size of the
   download portion in each message.
4. The server then immediately starts sending file portions, one per message, with
   the `chunk` message.
5. After the server has sent the last chunk it sends `finish` to the client.
6. Once the client receives the `finish` message and has assembled and verified
   the download it sends `download_complete` to the server with a status indicator.
   
#### Notify

  `key:value` pairs: `{"channel" : "channel_name", "value" : channel_value }`. The
   key `channel` is a string representing the name or identification of the channel
   as used by the `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` services. The `value` can be any
   JSON data type. In particular `value` can be a dictionary in itself, as it is
   with the `location` channel.

Currently defined channels:
