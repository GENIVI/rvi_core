# PROJECT MISSION STATEMENT #
*The Remote Vehicle Interaction project will specify, design, plan and
 build a reference implementation of the infrastructure that drives
 next generation's connected vehicle services.*

* **Specify**<br>
Requirement specifications, test suites, integration tests.

* **Design**<br>
High Level Description. Detailed Description. Use Cases.

* **Plan**<br>
Roadmap. Milestones. Deliverables. Budgeting. Resource planning.

* **Build**<br>
Implement. Document. Test. Demonstrate. Deploy for download.

* **Reference Implementation**<br>
Provides a baseline and starting point for organizations' production-grade connected vehicle projects.

# TECHNICAL SCOPE #

*RVI provides P2P based provisioning, authentication, authorization,
 discovery and invocation between services running inside and outside
 a vehicle.*

* **P2P**<br>
Internet connection not required for two peers to exchange services.

* **Provisioning**<br>
Add, delete, and modify services and network nodes.

* **Authentication & Authorization**<br>
Proves that a service is who it claims to be, and has the right to invoke another service.

* **Discovery**<br>
RVI is considered a safe bet that can be used without unforeseen consequences.

* **Invocation**<br>
RVI shall be able to function over transient and unreliable data channels, but also over a reliable in-vehicle LAN.


# PROJECT MILESTONES #
The demonstrator milestones will act as proof of concepts and
progress. Each milestone will deliver additional core functionality,
up to the point where the RVI system is complete at the final
deliverable.

1. **Remote HVAC control (Mid Sep 2014)**<br>
Pre-set the climate control of your vehicle from your mobile phone.

2. **Software Over The Air (SOTA) (Late Oct 2014)**<br>
Transfer, install, and validate a software package from a backend server to an IVI unit.

3. **Remote CAN bus monitoring (TBD)**<br>
Remotely subscribe to specific CAN frames, and have them delivered to a backend server.

4. **Remote control of IVI nav system (TBD)**<br>
Use remote mobile device to setup POI in vehicle's navigation system.


# TECHNOLOGY CHOICES #
The following chapters describe the technology choices made for the
reference implementation.  An overall goal was to avoid technology
lock-in while easing adoption by allowing organiztions to replace
individual components with in-house developted variants using their
own technology.

## INTERCHANGEABILITY ##
The only fixed parts of the entire RVI project are the JSON-RPC
protocol specifications used between the components themselves and
their connected services. 

AGL provides an RVI implementation as a starting point and a
reference. The adopting organization is free to use, rewrite, or
replace each component as they see fit. A typical example would be the
Service Discovery component, which must often be extended to interact
with organization-specific provisioning databases.

## COMMUNICATION AGNOSTICISM ##
In a similar manner, RVI places no requirements or expectations on the
communication protocol between two nodes, such as between a vehicle
and a backend server, in an RVI network. An organization is free to
integrate with any existing protocols, or develop new ones, as
necessary.

The reference implemantation provides an example of how to handle a
classic client-server model. The RVI design, however, can easily
handle such cases such as wakeup-SMS (used to get a vehicle to call in
to a server), packet-based data, peer-to-peer networks without any
dedicated servers, etc. The adopting organization can implement their
own Data Link and Protocol components to handle communication link
management and data encoding / decoding over any media (IP or non-IP).

## ERLANG ##
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) was chosen to implementation the core
components of the RVI system. Each component (see the
[HLD](https://wiki.automotivelinux.org/_media/eg-rvi/15-456-poc-rvi-hld_reva.pdf)
for details) run as an erlang application inside a single erlang node.

Several reasons exist for this somewhat unorthodox choice of
implementation language:

* **Robustness**<br>
Erlang has the ability to gracefully handle component crashes /
restarts without availability degradation. This makes a deployment
resiliant against the occasional bug and malfunction. In a similar
manner, redundant sites can be setup to handle catastrophic failures
and geographically distributed deployments.

* **Tool availability**<br>
There are a multitude of open source erlang components available to
handle SMS, GPIO, CAN buses, GPS, PPP links, and almost any protocol
out there. Since erlang was designed to handle the mobile
communication requirements that is at the center of the connected
vehicle, integrating with existing systems and protocols is often a
straight-forward process.

* **Scalability**<br>
The concurrent nature of an erlang system sets the stage for
horizontal scalaility by simply adding hosts to a deployment, allowing
an organziation to expand from a pilot fleet to a full fledged
international deployment.

* **Carrier grade availability**<br>
The robustness and scalaiblity, in conjunction with the built-in
erlang feature of runtime code upgrades, is a part of erlang's
five-nines uptime design that is rapidly becoming a core requirement
of the automotive industry.
 
* **Proven embedded system solution**<br>
Erlang has been adapted to operate well in embeded environments
with unreliable power, limited resources, and the need to integrate
with a wide variety of hardware.

## PYTHON ##
Python is used to implement all demonstrations, beginning
with the HVAC demo available in the ```hvac_demo``` subdirectory.

By using Python for the demos, which is better known than erlang,
examples are given on how to write applications and services
interfacing with the RVI system.

## PERFORMANCE ##
Performance is **not** a goal of the RVI reference
implementation. Instead, code readability and component
interchangeability takes priority in order to ease design
understanding and adoption. 

One example is the use of JSON-RPC (over HTTP) to handle internal
communication between components in a single Erlang node.

Using a traditional erlang solution such as genserver, the
overhead for internal transactions could be cut to a few percent in
comparison with the current JSON-RPC implementation. That route,
however, would force all components of the RVI system to be
implemented in Erlang, thus severly limiting an organizations
abilities to replace individual components with their own versions.


## CODE STRATEGY ##
All code in the RVI reference implementaion and its demonstrations are
written with a minimum of complexity and "magic". Readability is
paramount, even if it severly impact performance and memory usage.

All components in the RVI are kept small and distcinct, with a
well-defined JSON-RPC external interface and a simple call flows.

Only three external modules (lager, bert and exo) are used by the
code, with two more (setup and edown) used for release and
documentation management.

The reason for minimizing external module usage is to make the code
comprehensible and minimize the time a developer has to travesrse
through obscure libraries trying to understand what a specific call
flow actually does.

The entire reference implementation (as of the first alpa release) is
2800 lines of code, broken down into six standalone modules and one
library of shared primitive functions.

## JSON-RPC ##
JSON-RPC is  used for all  communication between components in  an RVI
system, and  also to  communicate with services  connected to  it. The
ubiquity of JSON-RPC, and its close relationship with Java/Javascript,
provides maximum of freedom of technology choices when new components,
services, and applications are developed.
