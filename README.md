# PROJECT MISSION STATEMENT #
*The Remote Vehicle Interaction project will specify, design, plan and
 build a reference implementation of the infrastructure that drives
 next generation's connected vehicle services.*

* **Specify**<br>
Requirement specifications, test suites, integration tests.

* **Design**<br>
High Level Description. Detailed Description. Use Cases.

* **Plan**<br>
Roadmap. Milestones. Deliverables. Budgeting. Resource planning.

* **Build**<br>
Implement. Document. Test. Demonstrate. Deploy for download.

* **Reference Implementation**<br>
Provides a baseline and starting point for organizations' production-grade connected vehicle projects.

# TECHNICAL SCOPE #

*RVI provides P2P based provisioning, authentication, authorization,
 discovery and invocation between services running inside and outside
 a vehicle.*

* **P2P**<br>
Internet connection not required for two peers to exchange services.

* **Provisioning**<br>
Add, delete, and modify services and network nodes.

* **Authentication & Authorization**<br>
Proves that a service is who it claims to be, and has the right to invoke another service.

* **Discovery**<br>
RVI is considered a safe bet that can be used without unforeseen consequences.

* **Invocation**<br>
RVI shall be able to function over transient and unreliable data channels, but also over a reliable in-vehicle LAN.


# TECHNOLOGY CHOICES #
The following chapters describe the technology choices made for the
reference implementation.  An overall goal was to avoid technology
lock-in while easing adoption by allowing organizations to replace
individual components with in-house developed variants using their
own technology.

## INTERCHANGEABILITY ##
The only fixed parts of the entire RVI project are the JSON-RPC
protocol specifications used between the components themselves and
their connected services.

GENIVI provides an RVI implementation as a starting point and a
reference. The adopting organization is free to use, rewrite, or
replace each component as they see fit. A typical example would be the
Service Discovery component, which must often be extended to interact
with organization-specific provisioning databases.

## COMMUNICATION AGNOSTICISM ##
In a similar manner, RVI places no requirements or expectations on the
communication protocol between two nodes, such as between a vehicle
and a backend server, in an RVI network. An organization is free to
integrate with any existing protocols, or develop new ones, as
necessary.

The reference implementation provides an example of how to handle a
classic client-server model. The RVI design, however, can easily
handle such cases such as wakeup-SMS (used to get a vehicle to call in
to a server), packet-based data, peer-to-peer networks without any
dedicated servers, etc. The adopting organization can implement their
own Data Link and Protocol components to handle communication link
management and data encoding / decoding over any media (IP or non-IP).

## ERLANG ##
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) was chosen to implementation the core
components of the RVI system. Each component (see the
[HLD](https://wiki.automotivelinux.org/_media/eg-rvi/15-456-poc-rvi-hld_reva.pdf)
for details) run as an Erlang application inside a single Erlang node.

Several reasons exist for this somewhat unorthodox choice of
implementation language:

* **Robustness**<br>
Erlang has the ability to gracefully handle component crashes /
restarts without availability degradation. This makes a deployment
resilient against the occasional bug and malfunction. In a similar
manner, redundant sites can be setup to handle catastrophic failures
and geographically distributed deployments.

* **Tool availability**<br>
There are a multitude of open source Erlang components available to
handle SMS, GPIO, CAN buses, GPS, PPP links, and almost any protocol
out there. Since Erlang was designed to handle the mobile
communication requirements that is at the center of the connected
vehicle, integrating with existing systems and protocols is often a
straight-forward process.

* **Scalability**<br>
The concurrent nature of an Erlang system sets the stage for
horizontal scalaility by simply adding hosts to a deployment, allowing
an organization to expand from a pilot fleet to a full fledged
international deployment.

* **Carrier grade availability**<br>
The robustness and scalability, in conjunction with the built-in
Erlang feature of runtime code upgrades, is a part of Erlang's
five-nines uptime design that is rapidly becoming a core requirement
of the automotive industry.

* **Proven embedded system solution**<br>
Erlang has been adapted to operate well in embedded environments
with unreliable power, limited resources, and the need to integrate
with a wide variety of hardware.

## PYTHON ##
Python is used to implement all demonstrations, beginning
with the HVAC demo available in the `hvac_demo` subdirectory.

By using Python for the demos, which is better known than Erlang,
examples are given on how to write applications and services
interfacing with the RVI system.

## PERFORMANCE ##
Performance is **not** a goal of the RVI reference
implementation. Instead, code readability and component
interchangeability takes priority in order to ease design
understanding and adoption.

One example is the use of JSON-RPC (over HTTP) to handle internal
communication between components in a single Erlang node.

Using a traditional Erlang solution such as genserver, the
overhead for internal transactions could be cut to a few percent in
comparison with the current JSON-RPC implementation. That route,
however, would force all components of the RVI system to be
implemented in Erlang, thus severely limiting an organization's
abilities to replace individual components with their own versions.

## JSON-RPC ##
JSON-RPC is used for all communication between components in an RVI
system, and also to communicate with services connected to it. The
ubiquity of JSON-RPC, and its close relationship with Java/JavaScript,
provides maximum of freedom of technology choices when new components,
services, and applications are developed.
